Old museum<br />
independantly all owned.<br />
Old meseum<br />
chopped apart with an axe.<br />
From blade of halifax<br />
to the noose of gibbet.<br />
Old museum.

My dad owned it,<br />
this joint of Pharoah<br />
with his crooked hat.

Through many years,<br />
the family museum changed hands,<br />
from many adventures afar.<br />
From a Genie in its ancient lamp,<br />
To many other lands of afar.<br />
And we would go out to eat,<br />
From Ethopia to streets of Japan.<br />
From bread for spoons,<br />
to roast beef in the frying pan.<br />
And yet dad kept it hidden,<br />
For many a year, do to lack of interest cleaning.<br />
Or perhaps to avoid the tax collector,<br />
Whom wants his dollars weening.

And yet it could be so much more,<br />
Like an independant library,<br />
Not a way for Phoroahs to be locked away,<br />
Into ancient history.
