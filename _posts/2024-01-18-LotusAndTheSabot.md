Lotus Sabot<br />
the flower and peasant ripples.<br />
Lotus Sabot,<br />
flower at midnight hour ripples<br />
between reality and the dream.<br />
Flowing in the lake is a leaf.<br />
Lotus Sabot.

Girl with baguette<br />
and boy on the bike waltz<br />
to Lotus et Sabot.

Between here and the city,<br />
is a girl with a rooster,<br />
and a girl with a bike.<br />
Riding on the sandunes, he waits.<br />
While the girl brings a rooster,<br />
and make an animal sacrifice.<br />
For they shall be more like the rooster<br />
And not the hen.<br />
She doesn't want to live,<br />
This boring country life again.

Lotus Sabot<br />
the flower and peasant ripples.<br />
Lotus Sabot,<br />
flower at midnight hour ripples<br />
between reality and the dream.<br />
Flowing in the lake is a leaf.<br />
Lotus Sabot.

Girl with baguette<br />
and boy on the bike waltz<br />
to Lotus et Sabot.

Instead they fly their Lotus flower,<br />
and their Rooster high,<br />
For the glory of chicken pie.<br />
One not made by the farm,<br />
but by the barracks,<br />
of another man's war.

And there in distance,<br />
Is a large flash of light and alarms,<br />
This was not the Lotus or the Sabot.
